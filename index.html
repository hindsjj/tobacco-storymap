                <p>
                    The tobacco retail environment, including convenience stores, gas stations, tobacco/vape shops, and other 
                    outlets, is the primary setting for the selling and marketing of tobacco/nicotine products. Youth are 
                    especially susceptible to tobacco access and marketing. Research supports that easy access to tobacco 
                    products, tobacco displays, discounts, and advertisements normalizes tobacco use and increases the chances 
                    that youth will try and use tobacco in the future. Retail exposure to electronic-cigarette (vape) ads is linked to 
                    a higher likelihood of vape use, vape brand preference, and a perception that vapes are less harmful than 
                    cigarettes. Research shows that tobacco retail and marketing is more concentrated (dense) in predominantly 
                    racially diverse and low-income communities.

                    <h2>Youth Exposure to Tobacco Retail in Idaho</h2>
                    <p>
                        Idaho is home to over 800 K-12 public and private schools serving over 300,000 students. 
                        There are over 1,600 tobacco retailers across Idaho. This work examines how the density and 
                        proximity of tobacco retail environments intersect with K-12 students' daily lives. This 
                        evaluation does not explore associations between retail tobacco exposure and tobacco use 
                        among youth or adults.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Measuring tobacco retail density and proximity to Idaho youth is important; it is well 
                        documented that increased exposure to tobacco products, marketing, and promotions is 
                        associated with youth tobacco experimentation and future use. Understanding youth tobacco 
                        retail exposure helps guide support for health education and actions to limit exposure to 
                        tobacco retail products and marketing.

                        This work describes youth 'tobacco exposure zones' as areas within a 1,000-foot radius 
                        of a tobacco retailer, a distance commonly used to measure youth proximity to tobacco retail.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tobacco exposure zones are indicated by grey circles on the map. The magenta circles represent schools 
                        that lie within a tobacco exposure zone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Notice the proximity of schools to tobacco retail in Pocatello. Many of these retailers are convenience 
                        stores and are along daily routes to school. Convenience stores often serve as community hubs in rural areas. 
                        Nationwide, nearly half (47.5%) of youth visit convenience stores at least once a week, and 14.9% visit 
                        daily for snacks and drinks. Convenience store visits are higher among youth living in rural areas and 
                        in areas of economic deprivation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Also notice the dense clustering of tobacco retail in central areas of Pocatello, which increases 
                        competitive pricing and creates advertising hotspots.

                <h2>Proximity Between Tobacco Retailers</h2>
                <p>
                    Research supports that clustering of tobacco retail is associated with higher tobacco 
                    use, decreased success at quitting, and earlier youth tobacco initiation. Clustering 
                    of tobacco retail increases price competition, leading to tobacco discounts, lower 
                    everyday prices, and increased marketing and promotions.

                        Idaho's public school districts vary dramatically in size, student population, and 
                        geographic setting. This map shows district boundaries across the state.

                    <p>
                        Warmer colors (oranges/reds) on the map indicate higher percentages of students exposed to tobacco 
                        retail within the district. These are typically rural areas, with fewer schools and 
                        lower populations.

                    <p>
                        Analyzing exposure at the district level helps identify which educational communities

                    <p>
                        The Area Deprivation Index (ADI) is a scientifically validated tool that ranks neighborhoods 
                        by social disadvantage by looking at factors beyond just income.

                        The ADI combines data on 
                        income, employment, education, and housing to determine an ADI score between 1 (lowest deprivation) 
                        and 10 (highest deprivation). The ADI is useful to identify, evaluate, and improve factors that 
                        impact health and quality of life across populations.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The map displays ADI for Idaho at the census block level, using state-only deciles. 
                        Warmer colors (reds/oranges) indicate more disadvantaged areas, while cooler colors (blues) 
                        indicate less disadvantaged areas. The small grey/black circles represent tobacco exposure 
                        zones, with the black areas indicating high concentration of tobacco retail. Note that some 
                        of the most disadvantage areas also have the highest concentration of tobacco retail.
