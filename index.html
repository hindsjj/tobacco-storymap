                <h2 style="max-width:700px" class="mx-auto">Why Youth Exposure to Tobacco Products and Marketing Matters</h2>
                <p>
                    The tobacco retail environment, including convenience stores, gas stations, tobacco/vape shops, 
                    and other outlets, is the primary setting for the selling and marketing of tobacco/nicotine products. 
                    Youth are especially susceptible to tobacco access and marketing. Research supports that easy 
                    access to tobacco products, tobacco displays, discounts, and advertisements normalizes tobacco use, 
                    and increases the chances youth will try tobacco and use tobacco in the future. Retail exposure to 
                    e-cigarette ads (vapes) is linked to a higher likelihood of vape use, vape brand preference, and a 
                    perception that vapes are less harmful than cigarettes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A higher density of tobacco retailers (especially around schools and youth-oriented locations) is 
                    associated with impulse (unintended) purchases, increased youth and adult tobacco use rates, and 
                    less successful quit attempts<sup>1</sup>. Research shows that tobacco retail and marketing is more concentrated 
                    (dense) in predominantly racially diverse and low-income communities.

                    <h2>Youth Exposure to Tobacco Retail in Idaho</h2>
                    <p>
                        Idaho is home to over 800 K-12 public and private schools serving over 300,000 students. 
                        There are over 1,600 tobacco retailers across Idaho. This work examines how the density 
                        and proximity of tobacco retail environments intersect with the daily life of K-12 students. 
                        This work does not explore associations between retail tobacco exposure and tobacco use 
                        among youth or adults.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Measuring tobacco retail density and proximity to Idaho youth is important. It is well 
                        documented that increased exposure to tobacco products, marketing, and promotions is 
                        associated with youth tobacco experimentation and future use. Understanding youth tobacco 
                        retail exposure helps guide support for health education and actions to limit tobacco 
                        retail product and marketing exposure.

                            and other youth-oriented locations. Overall, almost 20% (19.6%) of schools in Idaho 
                            are located within 1,000 feet of at least one tobacco retailer. There is great

                            restrict tobacco retailers within 500 or 1,000 feet of schools to reduce youth 
                            exposure to tobacco products, marketing and promotion.

                        This work describes youth 'tobacco exposure zones' as areas within a 1,000-foot radius 
                        of a tobacco retailer, a distance commonly used to measure youth proximity to tobacco retail.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tobacco exposure zones are indicated by grey circles on the map. The magenta circles represent schools 
                        that lie within a tobacco exposure zone.

                    <p>
                        Notice the proximity of schools to tobacco retail in Pocatello. Many of these retailers are convenience 
                        stores and are along daily routes to school. Nationwide, nearly half (47.5%) of youth visit convenience 
                        stores at least once a week, and 14.9% visit daily for snacks and drinks<sup>2</sup>. Convenience store visits are 
                        higher among youth living in rural areas and in areas of economic deprivation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Also notice the dense clustering of tobacco retail in central areas of Pocatello, which increases 
                        competitive pricing and creates advertising hotspots.

                <h2>Proximity Between Tobacco Retailers</h2>
                <p>
                    Research supports that clustering of tobacco retail is associated with higher tobacco use, 
                    decreased success at quitting, and earlier youth tobacco initiation. Clustering of tobacco 
                    retail increases price competition leading to tobacco discounts, lower everyday prices, and 
                    increased marketing and promotions<sup>3</sup>.
                </p> 
                <p>
                    This work maps and provides the number and percentage of tobacco retailers by county within 
                    500 feet of one another, a common measure of high tobacco retail proximity. There is no legal 
                    or accepted standard for distance between tobacco retailers in Idaho. Cities and counties 
                    in the US have adopted laws and ordinances to restrict tobacco retail proximity.

                        Idaho's public school districts vary dramatically in size, student population, and 
                        geographic setting. This map shows district boundaries across the state.

                    <p>
                        Warmer colors on the map indicate higher percentages of students exposed to tobacco 
                        retail within the district. These are typically rural areas, with fewer schools and 
                        lower populations.

                    <p>
                        Analyzing exposure at the district level helps identify which educational communities

                    <p>
                        The Area Deprivation Index (ADI) is a scientifically validated tool that ranks neighborhoods by 
                        social disadvantage by looking at factors beyond just income.

                        The ADI combines data on income, 
                        employment, education, and housing to determine an ADI score between 1 (lowest deprivation) to 
                        10 (highest deprivation). The ADI is useful to identify, evaluate, and improve factors that 
                        impact health and quality of life across populations.

                        The map displays ADI for Idaho at the census block level, using state-only deciles. 
                        Warmer colors indicate more disadvantaged areas, while cooler colors indicate less 
                        disadvantaged areas. The small grey/black circles represent tobacco exposure zones, 
                        with the black areas indicating high concentration of tobacco retail. Note that some 
                        of the most disadvantage areas also have the highest concentration of tobacco retail.
